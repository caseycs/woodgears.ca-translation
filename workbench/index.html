I had previously posted an article about <a href="build.html">
building this style of workbench</a>, but I recently built another one
like this for my friend Roland, this time shooting video of the build.
And so I figured I might as well do a more detailed write-up
on how to build it using pictures from the video.
<p>
To demonstrate that you don't need a workshop full of tools to build one
of these, I'm building this one with just a WorkMate, a cheap circular saw,
a hand drill, bar clamps, a square, and a chisel.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench02-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=596>

Getting clean crosscuts is really important. So I made a simple T-square
cross-cutting guide by gluing a scrap of plywood across another scrap of wood.
Clamping this to the 2x4 gives a good edge to guide the saw.
<p>
The guide ends exactly where the saw cuts, so it's just a matter of positioning
the edge of the guide against where the cut is to be made.

</p><br clear=left><p>


<a href="bench03-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=581>
<img src="bench03.jpg" width=500 height=323 align=left></a>
With the guide clamped to the 2x4, I can use both hands to guide the saw.

<a href="bench04-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=699>
<img src="bench04.jpg" width=500 height=388 align=left></a>
I'm joining the legs to cross-pieces with dowels. Here I'm using some scraps of wood
to clamp the leg against the end of the cross-piece.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench05-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=748>
<img src="bench05.jpg" width=500 height=416 align=left></a>
I'm also adding some screws to the joint (I didn't do this on my last build,
but screws make the build much easier).
The screws really help to hold the joint together while drilling the dowel
holes.  I pre-drill a shank hole, 5/32" in size for the #7 drywall
screw.  I set the drill bit deep into the chuck so that my drill only drills
through the first 2x4.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench06-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=658>
<img src="bench06.jpg" width=500 height=366 align=left></a>
After pre-drilling, I add two 3" long drywall screws.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench07-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=700>
<img src="bench07.jpg" width=500 height=389 align=left></a>
With the screws in place, I drill two 5/8" (16 mm) holes for the dowels.
Because I'm drilling through both pieces at the same time,
the holes will line up even if I drill the holes a little crooked.
<p>
To get more depth with the drill bit, I only partially inserted it into the chuck.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench08-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=607>
<img src="bench08.jpg" width=500 height=337 align=left></a>
Before gluing in the dowel, I took the joint apart again and added glue to the flat
joint surface.  I'm not sure if this will help much, but it certainly can't hurt!
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench09-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=592>
<img src="bench09.jpg" width=500 height=329 align=left></a>
I used a thin stick of wood to spread glue all over the inside of the hole and to
the outside of the dowel.  Then the dowels are inserted in the holes.  I had a
tight fit, so I had to drive the dowels in with a hammer!
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench10-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=591>
<img src="bench10.jpg" width=500 height=328 align=left></a>
Two cross pieces attached to one leg, and the other leg already drilled.  Here
I just took the joint apart again to put glue on  the inside surfaces before
putting it back together and inserting the dowels.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench11-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=622>
<img src="bench11.jpg" width=500 height=346 align=left></a>
Excess glue squeezeout can be messy.  It's best to rub sawdust onto the squeezed out
glue.  Sawdust absorbs the excess glue and prevents it from getting smeared everywhere.
<p>
A chisel is good to scrape the glue soaked sawdust back off, and to
<a href="../dowel/flush_cut.html">flush trim the dowels</a> if you need to.
<p>
The doweling is the hardest part of the build.  If you aren't up for it, I'd recommend
using four or six drywall screws, 3" or 3.5" long instead of two screws and two dowels.
Drill a 5/32" shank hole for the screw, and a 3/32" pilot hole in the end grain,
just to reduce the chance of splitting the wood with that many screws.

</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench12-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=633>
<img src="bench12.jpg" width=500 height=352 align=left></a>
With the leg frames built, checking how it all goes together.
<p>
Next I need to cut some dadoes into the long rails.  These dadoes aren't strictly
necessary, but make for a more secure joint with the legs.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench13-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=489>
<img src="bench13.jpg" width=500 height=272 align=left></a>
I set my circular saw to cut about one third into the rails.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench14-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=534>
<img src="bench14.jpg" width=500 height=297 align=left></a>
Two lines mark where the dado needs to be cut.  I set my cutting guide
back from the first line by the thickness of the blade, as I want to cut
on the other side of the first line.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench15-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=586>
<img src="bench15.jpg" width=500 height=326 align=left></a>
I make a cut on either line with my cutting gauge, followed by a series of
free-hand cuts in between.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench16-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=582>
<img src="bench16.jpg" width=500 height=323 align=left></a>
I then use a hammer to chip out most of the wood between the cuts...

<a href="bench17-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=626>
<img src="bench17.jpg" width=500 height=348 align=left></a>
... then clean up the bottom with a chisel.  A sharp chisel makes this much easier.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench18-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=628>
<img src="bench18.jpg" width=500 height=349 align=left></a>
I also cut the lower corners of these rails at a 45-degree angle, strictly for
cosmetic reasons.  I marked that with a square, but cut it freehand.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench19-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=555>
<img src="bench19.jpg" width=500 height=309 align=left></a>
To make it easier to attach the workbench top, I'm gluing some 1.5x1.5x8" blocks of wood
to the rails.  I ripped these from a scrap of 2x4.
<p>
You could also use pocket holes to attach the table top, but I don't have a pocket hole
jig, so adding blocks was easier.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench20-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=656>
<img src="bench20.jpg" width=500 height=364 align=left></a>
Next, pre-drilling the screw holes for attaching the rails.  I'm drilling these
with a 5/32" drill.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="bench21-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=639>
<img src="bench21.jpg" width=500 height=355 align=left></a>
Then screwing on the rails.  Much easier to do with the workbench lying on its side!
<p>
It's been suggested that part of the legs should be cut away as well to form
a shoulder to help hold up the rails.  But this would complicate the build and
weaken the dowel joint by cutting away part of it.
I find the screws hold up the vertical load just fine.

</p><br clear=left><p id="blocks">
<a href="bench22-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=616>
<img src="bench22.jpg" width=500 height=342 align=left></a>
After that, screwing in the workbench top, from the bottom.
<p>
The workbench top is an old wooden door - one from the 1950s, when they still used 1/4"
plywood for the sides of it.  It's quite heavy, solid enough to bolt a vise to.
<p>
Modern inside doors are too flimsy to use as table tops, but
new solid core doors make even better workbench tops.
<p>
The last time I built one of these, I just screwed the door on from the top, but
my friend has some plywood he wants to put on top of the door, so I figured it's
better to screw the door on from below.

<a href="delivered-b.jpg" bigw=900 bigh=670>
<img src="delivered.jpg" width=500 height=372 align=left></a>
Workbench dropped off at my friend Roland's.
What a difference good lighting and white walls make!  I'm sure glad I decided
to build it in my shop and then deliver it.
